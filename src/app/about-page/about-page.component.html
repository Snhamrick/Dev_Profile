            <p>Hello, my name is Seth Hamrick, a full stack/frontend web developer. I currently reside in Summersville, WV and have had a somewhat unique journey. I began my career as a General Dentist graduating from WVU in 2019. I worked as a General Dentist for 4 years during which time I sought a different career path. I desired a career where I could collaborate with other people, continue learning daily, and design and build more. I returned to school online at Southern New Hampshire University in 2021 and completed the computer science program in 2023. During my time at SNHU I found my passion for software development, specifically web development. While at SNHU I gained exposure to several programming languages including Python, Java, and C++. I also learned many software development principles including SDLC, security, and Agile development. Towards the end of the program, I was exposed to full stack development with a focus using the MEAN stack. Since that point I have deployed several small projects utilizing the MEAN stack and improving my skills along the way. I am now seeking opportunities to gain professional experience along with working as part of a team to enhance my skills even further. I may have limited experience to this point, but I am highly motivated and believe that I am a rapid learner. <br><br>
            In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and wife. I follow all sports heavily and I am an avid fan of Chelsea FC. I also enjoy spending time in the gym lifting weights. When I am not doing these activities, I often do research and practice to help improve in areas that I feel I am lacking.<br><br>
            As I mentioned previously, I am actively looking for opportunities to gain experience and grow. If you are interested in contacting me, please visit my contact page where you can send me an email directly!
